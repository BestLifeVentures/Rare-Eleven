3. In the admin panel, use URLs from image hosting services like:
   - Unsplash
   - Imgur
   - Your own image hosting
   - Google Drive (public links)

## Testing

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Verify the logo appears in the header
3. Check that 3 banner paintings display
4. Scroll down to see the gallery
5. Test the filter buttons
6. Test admin access by searching "Alyssa Barresi" in the footer

## Image Recommendations
