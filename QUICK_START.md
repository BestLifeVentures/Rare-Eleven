## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see my banner images!"
- Did you click "Save Banner Configuration"?
- Did you refresh the page?
- Are your image URLs direct links? (Should end in .jpg or .png)
- Test URL in new tab - does it show ONLY the image?

### "My gallery is empty!"
- Did you add artworks through admin panel?
- Click "Add Artwork" button after filling the form
- Refresh main page

### "How do I get direct image URLs?"
See [CLOUD_SETUP.md](CLOUD_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions for:
- Google Drive
- Imgur
- Dropbox
- Cloudinary

## Pro Tips

### Customize Positions
Play with the positioning to create an interesting layout:
- **Left %**: 0 = far left, 100 = far right
- **Top %**: 0 = top, 100 = bottom
- **Width**: Bigger = 500-600px, Smaller = 200-300px

### Mix Frame Styles
Try different frames for each painting:
- Classic Wood (brown)
- Gold (luxury)
- Dark Wood (dramatic)
- Modern Silver (contemporary)
- No Frame (minimalist)

### Collections
Organize your artworks into collections:
- **Collection A**: Abstract
- **Collection B**: Modern
- **Collection C**: Traditional
- **Collection D**: Contemporary

Users can filter by these on the main page!
